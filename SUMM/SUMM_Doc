I am happy to announce my new application, “SUMM,” designed to help businesses across various industries better understand customer expectations in their area while learning from competitors’ successes and mistakes.

❓ Why does it matter?
In today’s competitive environment, competitive intelligence—collecting and analyzing information from competitors’—has become vital, even for local businesses. Every customer walking through your door represents an opportunity, and understanding their expectations or hesitations can help businesses to avoid common issues and exceed expectations.

🎯 What does SUMM do?
SUMM provides tailored recommendations by analyzing Google Maps reviews of competitors within a specific radius of your business. It helps you uncover:
✔️ What customers love about competitors.
✔️ What concerns or frustrations they have.
✔️ How to stand out by addressing unmet expectations.

📍 Coming Soon:
SUMM will soon be available on both the App Store and Google Play Store
